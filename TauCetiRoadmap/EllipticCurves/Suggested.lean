# Elliptic curves: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the conventions, the layer-by-layer build plan Layers 0–7, the worked
examples, and the references) is in `README.md`. Mathlib has the Weierstrass model
(`WeierstrassCurve R`, `WeierstrassCurve.IsElliptic`, `WeierstrassCurve.j`, `VariableChange`,
`baseChange`), the group law on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point` — proved through the coordinate
ring `Affine.CoordinateRing` and function field `Affine.FunctionField`, with the injective
class-group map `Point.toClass` — the division polynomials and elliptic divisibility sequences,
reduction over a DVR, and heights and the `L`-function definition. It has **no** theory of places
of the function field, **no** isogenies, **no** Weil pairing, **no** finiteness or count of
`E(𝔽_q)` and hence **no** Hasse bound, **no** Tate curve, **no** twists, **no** Tate's algorithm,
and neither the **Mordell–Weil** theorem nor **Selmer/Sha**. We build these in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/`, on the function field of a Weierstrass curve and its
places (Layer 0), with an isogeny defined as a function-field embedding, backwards (Layer 1):

```
structure Isogeny (W₁ W₂ : Affine K) where
  pullback : W₂.FunctionField →ₐ[K] W₁.FunctionField
  mapsInfinity : inducedPlace pullback W₁.infinityPlace = W₂.infinityPlace
```

(D. Angdinata's definition, from this roadmap's review) — no schemes anywhere, and AEC/ATAEC
cited for the mathematics, not as the specification.

`sorry` is allowed in this human-owned roadmap library — these are goals, not proofs. Following
the roadmap-writing guide, objects with a genuine type are pinned as `def … := sorry` (the Weil
pairing, the quadratic twist), and only statements are `theorem … := sorry`; nothing is a
`Prop`-typed placeholder. The layers whose central objects are new *types* — the places of the
function field (Layer 0), the isogeny type, the dual isogeny, the invariant differential and the
formal group (Layer 1), the Kodaira type and the Tate-curve isomorphism (Layer 4), and the
Selmer/Sha groups (Layer 7) — need the very API those layers introduce; they are specified in
`README.md` and built there, not pinned here as `sorry`-typed junk types.

## Provenance (migrate and clean from existing sorry-free work)

The isogeny layer coordinates with D. Angdinata's in-flight mathlib work (the isogeny and
Weil-pairing development the definition above comes from, and the division-polynomial
upstreaming); the AINTLIB modular-curves scheme development is, after the function-field pivot,
a strategy library and feasibility evidence rather than a port source (`README.md` §Provenance).
The Hasse bound is proved `sorry`-free in the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project, as the capstone
`hasse_bound` of `HasseWeil/WeilPairing/HasseBound.lean` (the sibling `HasseWeil/HasseBound.lean`
is the conditional skeleton, not the capstone; revision pins and the axiom audit are in
`README.md` §Provenance). The twist layer (`quadraticTwistOf` and its invariants,
`quadraticTwist`, `quadraticTwistPointEquiv`, and `exists_quadraticTwist_hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`)
exists in FLT as several thousand lines of AI-generated Lean; the plan is to bring it **into Tau
Ceti first** rather than to consume it from FLT, and the Layer 5 seeds use its names so the two line
up. `E[N] ≅ (ℤ/N)²` has a scheme-theoretic proof in the AINTLIB modular-curves development
(`torsion_geometricFibre_rank_two`), restated here over `WeierstrassCurve`. Mordell–Weil follows
Michael Stoll's AI-assisted formalisation (repository, revision, and licence pinned in `README.md`
§Provenance). These are sources of proofs to migrate, not the specification.

/-! ## Layer 0: the function field, places, and divisors

The foundation. Mathlib already has the coordinate ring `Affine.CoordinateRing` (an integral
domain), the function field `Affine.FunctionField` (its fraction field), and the injective
class-group map `Point.toClass`. This layer builds the **places** of the function field — the
place at infinity `W.infinityPlace`, the place of an affine point, `inducedPlace` along a
`K`-algebra map, degrees — the point–place dictionary (`W.toAffine.Point` ↔ the degree-`1`
places), and the divisor calculus (`div f`, `deg (div f) = 0`), specified in `README.md`
§Layer 0; the types are new API and are built there, not pinned here. The milestone statable
against today's Mathlib is that `toClass` is onto the class group: -/

/-- **The point group is the ideal class group** (AEC III.3.4–5): for an elliptic `W`, Mathlib's
`Point.toClass` — injective upstream (`toClass_injective`) — is also **surjective**, so
`W.toAffine.Point ≃+ Additive (ClassGroup W.toAffine.CoordinateRing)`. This is the Layer-0
divisor anchor: the class group is the degree-`0` divisor class group of the function field in
disguise, so the principal-divisor characterisation (`Σ nᵢ Pᵢ` is principal iff `deg = 0` and
`Σ [nᵢ] Pᵢ = O`) rides on the group law Mathlib already proved, with no Riemann–Roch anywhere. -/
theorem toClass_surjective {K : Type*} [Field K] (W : WeierstrassCurve K) [W.IsElliptic] :
    Function.Surjective <| WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.toClass (W := W.toAffine) :=
  sorry

/-! ## Layer 1: isogenies, the dual, the invariant differential, and formal groups (AEC II.2, III.4–6, IV)

An isogeny `φ : W₁ → W₂` is a `K`-algebra map of function fields, backwards, fixing infinity:

```
structure Isogeny (W₁ W₂ : Affine K) where
  pullback : W₂.FunctionField →ₐ[K] W₁.FunctionField
  mapsInfinity : inducedPlace pullback W₁.infinityPlace = W₂.infinityPlace
```

Such a map is automatically injective and finite, so `deg φ` is `Module.finrank`, separability
is that of the field extension, multiplicativity of `deg` under composition is the tower
formula, and the `q`-power Frobenius (`pullback = (·) ^ q`) is purely inseparable of degree `q`
— field theory Mathlib already has. The type needs Layer 0's places, so it is specified in
`README.md` §Layer 1 and built there, together with the hom-group (zero adjoined) and the
quadraticity of the degree, the dual isogeny with `φ̂ ∘ φ = [deg φ]`, `deg [n] = n²` via the
division polynomials, and the invariant differential `ω` in `Ω[W.FunctionField⁄K]` with
`φ^* = KaehlerDifferential.map` and the formal group. The one milestone statable against the
existing point group is the surjectivity of multiplication-by-`n`: over a separably closed
field, `[n]` is surjective on points for `n` invertible in `K` (AEC III.4.10), the counting
input to `E[N] ≅ (ℤ/N)²`. -/

/-- **Multiplication-by-`n` is surjective on `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)`** (AEC III.4.10) over a separably closed
field, for `n` **invertible in `K`** (`(n : K) ≠ 0`, i.e. `char K ∤ n` — which also forces
`n ≠ 0`). The invertibility is what makes `[n]` separable (`[n]^*ω = n·ω`, Layer 1), and only a
separable isogeny is surjective on `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points: over an imperfect separably closed field
(e.g. `𝔽_p(t)ˢᵉᵖ`) the fibres of an inseparable `[n]` live in a purely inseparable extension, so
the bare `n ≠ 0` claim is false as stated. (Over `[IsAlgClosed K]` every `n ≠ 0` works, but the
separably closed statement is the one the torsion count consumes.) Here `n • ·` is the `n`-fold
sum in the point group; the kernel is `E[n]`, whose structure is `torsion_linearEquiv_prod`
below. -/

/-! ## Layer 2: torsion, the Weil pairing, and the Tate module (AEC III.6–8)

`E[N]` is the `ℤ`-module `N`-torsion of the point group, `Submodule.torsionBy ℤ (E.Point) N`. -/

attribute [local instance] AddSubgroup.torsionBy.zmodModule in
/-- **`E[N] ≅ (ℤ/N)²`** (AEC III.6.4): over a separably closed field `K` in which `N` is invertible
(`(N : K) ≠ 0`, i.e. `char K ∤ N`), the `N`-torsion is a **free `ZMod N`-module of rank `2`** —
stated as a `ZMod N`-linear equivalence with `ZMod N × ZMod N`, since freeness-plus-rank-two is
the form the Tate module and the Galois representation (`README.md` §Layer 2) consume. The
carrier `AddSubgroup.torsionBy A (N : ℤ)` is Mathlib's `A[N]`, reducibly the
`Submodule.torsionBy ℤ A (N : ℤ)` used by `weilPairing` below; its `ZMod N`-module structure is
`AddSubgroup.torsionBy.zmodModule` (a plain `def` upstream, hence the local-instance attribute).
The statement is wrapped in `Nonempty` because the equivalence — a choice of basis — is
noncanonical; and it is no stronger than its `≃+` form, since an additive equivalence of
`ZMod N`-modules is automatically `ZMod N`-linear. This is the "N-torsion" milestone. -/

/-- **The Weil pairing** `e_N : E[N] × E[N] → μ_N` (AEC III.8.1), over **any** field — no closure
hypothesis. Pinned as an additive **bilinear** map (`→+ →+`, i.e. linear in both variables) into
`Additive (rootsOfUnity N K)`, so `ℤ`-bilinearity and the `μ_N`-valued codomain are part of the
type. It is alternating and, over a separably closed field with `N` invertible in `K`,
nondegenerate
(`weilPairing_nondegenerate`); the load-bearing API is **functoriality under change of field**
(`README.md` §Layer 2). -/

/-- The **Weil pairing is nondegenerate** over a separably closed field (AEC III.8.1(d)): if
`e_N(P, Q) = 0` for every `Q`, then `P = 0`. Bilinearity and the `μ_N`-valued codomain are already
in the type of `weilPairing`, so together this makes `e_N` a perfect pairing. (`[NeZero N]` is kept
only because the `weilPairing` definition needs it as an instance; `hN` supplies the invertibility
nondegeneracy actually requires.) -/

/-- **`E(𝔽_q)` is finite** — a prerequisite Mathlib lacks (needed even for the count to make
sense). -/

    Finite W.toAffine.Point :=
  sorry

/-- **The Hasse bound** (AEC V.1.1) — the headline. With `a_q := q + 1 − #E(𝔽_q)` the trace of
Frobenius, the natural formalisation goal is the integer inequality `a_q² ≤ 4q` (the real form
`|#E − (q+1)| ≤ 2√q` follows), from `deg(1 − φ_q) = #E(𝔽_q)`, positivity of the degree form, and
Cauchy–Schwarz on it (AEC V.1.2). `Nat.card W.toAffine.Point` counts the projective points (with
the point at infinity); `Nat.card K = q`. ⚠ `finite_point` above is a **required companion**, not
a nicety: `Nat.card` of an infinite type is `0`, which would make this inequality false rather
than vacuous, so the bound is only the honest count together with `finite_point` — any proof
necessarily establishes it. -/

/-! ## Layer 4: local fields — reduction, Tate's algorithm, the Tate curve (AEC VII, ATAEC IV–V)

The reduction filtration `0 → E₁(K) → E₀(K) → Ẽ_ns(k) → 0` on the points of a minimal equation,
the Kodaira type (an enumerated type, defined as the output of Tate's algorithm), the conductor
exponent, the local index `c_p`, and the Tate-curve isomorphism `Kˢᵉᵖ^× / qᶻ ≅ E_q(Kˢᵉᵖ)` are
new objects specified in `README.md` §Layer 4 and built there on Layers 0–1 and Mathlib's
reduction theory; they are not pinned here as `sorry`-typed types. Néron models are **out of
scope**: they are schemes, and belong to the future scheme-facing roadmap (`README.md`). -/

/-! ## Layer 5: twists (AEC X.2, X.5)

These are twists of the **pointed** curve `(E, O)`: elliptic curves over `K` that become
isomorphic to `E` over `Kˢᵉᵖ` as pointed curves, classified by `H¹(Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K), Aut (E, O))` —
over `Kˢᵉᵖ` every isomorphism of pointed Weierstrass curves is a change of variables, so
`Aut (E, O)` is the stabiliser of the base-changed curve in Mathlib's `VariableChange` group and
the descent is cocycle-level, with no schemes. A pointed twist keeps its rational point, hence has a Weierstrass model — this
is a different theory from the **genus-one torsors** (no rational point, classified by
`H¹(Gal, E(Kˢᵉᵖ))`), which belong to the Weil–Châtelet/Sha circle of `README.md` §Layer 7. For
`j ≠ 0, 1728`, `Aut (E, O) ≅ {±1}` and the twists are the quadratic twists: for `char K ≠ 2`
classified by `K^×/(K^×)²`, in characteristic `2` by the Artin–Schreier group `K/℘(K)`
(`README.md` §Layer 5). The seeds below are the concrete quadratic case: the exact shapes of the
`sorry`-free FLT quadratic-twist development (`ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT` #1088) — several
thousand lines of AI Lean, to be brought into Tau Ceti first — so porting it is a transcription
rather than a re-derivation, and the construction is characteristic-free. A quadratic twist is a
twist by a **quadratic** `x² − t x + n` (trace `t`, norm `n`), with discriminant `D = t² − 4n` —
equivalently, by a separable quadratic extension `L/K`, carried by the
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension K L` typeclass (in pinned Mathlib, and used directly by FLT). The
Galois character of the point isomorphism uses FLT's `quadraticCharacter`, so it is stated in
`README.md` §Layer 5 rather than seeded here. -/

/-- **The quadratic twist** `E_{t,n}` by the quadratic `x² − t x + n` (FLT `quadraticTwistOf`),
over any `CommRing`. Its discriminant is `D⁶ · Δ(E)` with `D = t² − 4n` (`Δ_quadraticTwistOf`), so
it is elliptic exactly when `D` is **invertible** — seeded below over a field, where that is
`D ≠ 0`, exactly as FLT states it — with the same `j`-invariant. This is the primitive the
whole layer (and FLT's split-reduction theorem) is built from. -/

/-- **The twist of an elliptic curve is elliptic** when `D = t² − 4n ≠ 0`, over a **field** —
exactly as FLT states it (`isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf`). Over a mere `CommRing` the conclusion
needs `IsUnit D`, not `D ≠ 0` (`Δ ↦ D⁶Δ`, and `D⁶ · unit` is a unit only when `D` is: take
`A = ℤ`, `D = 2`); nonzero-implies-unit is what the field supplies. The invariant identities
above stay ring-level. -/

`quadraticTwist`): twist by the trace and norm of a generator of `L/K`, a `WeierstrassCurve K`

/-! ## Layer 6: the Mordell–Weil theorem (AEC VIII) -/

/-- **The Mordell–Weil theorem** (AEC VIII.6.7): over a number field `K`, the group of points
`E(K)` is finitely generated. `AddGroup.FG` is finite generation as an abelian group; its free rank
is the **rank** of `E/K` and its torsion subgroup is finite (Nagell–Lutz, `README.md` §Layer 6).
The proof is weak Mordell–Weil — `E(K)/2E(K)` finite by the Kummer (`x − θ`) argument, whose
finiteness input is the `S`-class group and `S`-unit theorems of number fields, **not** Layer 7's
elliptic-curve Selmer group — plus the theory of heights, by descent (`README.md` §Layer 6; this
is also how the existing formalisation proves it, there under a short-normal-form hypothesis that
the port removes by variable change). Statement-named per Mathlib convention — the name describes
the conclusion, matching the existing formalisation's `fg_point_of_numberField`, and

The `m`-descent sequence `0 → E(K)/mE(K) → Selₘ(E/K) → Ш(E/K)[m] → 0`, the finiteness of the
`m`-Selmer group `Selₘ(E/K)` (the **effective refinement** of Layer 6's weak Mordell–Weil — a
computable bound on the rank, not its prerequisite), and the Shafarevich–Tate group `Ш(E/K)` are
specified in `README.md` §Layer 7. Pinned Mathlib already has the cohomological substrate
(continuous cohomology of topological groups, `groupCohomology` with its low-degree API and long
exact sequence, nonabelian `H¹`); what gates this layer is the **Galois-specific packaging** on
top — profinite Galois modules with the finite-level comparison, the Kummer connecting map for
`[m]`, inflation–restriction there, and the local conditions at the places of `K` — listed
precisely in `README.md` §Layer 7. Nothing is pinned here; the layer states its objects against
that API once it exists. -/
