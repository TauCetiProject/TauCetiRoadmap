# Contour integration and the HW generalized residue theorem: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the conventions, the layer-by-layer build plan Layers 0–4, the worked
examples, and the references) is in `README.md`. Mathlib has the Cauchy integral formula, circle
integrals, and the local meromorphic-function API (`MeromorphicOn` in
`Analysis/Meromorphic/Basic.lean`, `meromorphicOrderAt` in `Analysis/Meromorphic/Order.lean`,
`circleMap`/`circleIntegral` in `MeasureTheory/Integral/CircleIntegral.lean` and
`Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Complex/CircleMap.lean`, the Cauchy kernel
`circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`). It has **no** winding number for a general
piecewise-`C¹` cycle, **no** residue, **no** Cauchy principal-value contour integral, **no**
argument principle, **no** global (homological) Cauchy theorem, and — the ultimate target — **no**
Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (arXiv:1808.00997, Thm 3.3) for singularities lying
*on* the cycle, with non-integer winding-number weights. We build that in `TauCeti/Analysis/Contour/`.

This file pins the roadmap's load-bearing **definitions** (`windingNumber`, `residue`,
`HasCauchyPV`, `IsPiecewiseC1On`, `IsPwC1ImmersionOn`, the HW conditions, `IsNullHomologous`) and its
**named milestones** as `sorry`-targets
(`sorry` is allowed in this human-owned roadmap library — these are goals, not proofs). The
`def`s fix the objects the roadmap is *about* so the statements below are expressible at all; the
generalized winding number, the classical residue theorem, the homology Cauchy theorem and HW
Thm 3.3 are then stated against them.

The argument-principle milestones are statable today with Mathlib's `logDeriv` (`= f'/f`),
`meromorphicOrderAt` (`= ord_c f`), and `circleIntegral`, yet are genuinely absent from Mathlib
(which has `logDeriv`, `Meromorphic/Divisor`, Jensen's formula, and Nevanlinna theory, but no
residue, argument principle, or winding number). The bare residue theorem for poles *off* a circle
is a short corollary of the Cauchy integral formula and so is folded into the Layer-2
`classicalResidueTheorem_circle` only; the general arbitrary-cycle / null-homologous residue theorem
is Layer 3+ (it is at least as strong as the homology Cauchy theorem). Everything here elaborates
against the pinned Mathlib.

## Provenance (migrate and clean from AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`)

The proofs exist, `sorry`-free, in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB)); migrating them is the
cleanup opportunity. File map (relative to that project's `LeanModularForms/`):

* Generalized winding number (Layers 0–1, HW §2): `ForMathlib/GeneralizedWindingNumber.lean`,
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Homotopy/{Invariance,Integrality}.lean`,
  `ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/Crossing.lean` (Prop 2.2 / sector geometry).
* Arc FTC / Cauchy primitive (Layer 2): `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/CauchyPrimitive.lean`,
  `…/ArcCalculus.lean`, `ForMathlib/ArcFTC*.lean`.
* Residues, the argument principle, and the classical residue theorem (Layer 2):
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Residue.lean`, `…/Residue/GeneralizedTheoremBase.lean`
  (`generalizedResidueTheorem'`, `residueSimplePole`, `residueAt`, `simple_poles_decomposition`).
* Global (homological) Cauchy theorem, via Dixon's argument (Layer 3):
  `ForMathlib/DixonDef.lean`, `…/DixonDiff.lean`, `…/DixonTheorem.lean`.
* HW generalized residue theorem (Layer 4, Thm 3.3, conditions (A′)/(B)):
  `ForMathlib/HW33Clean.lean` (`hw_3_3_clean_full_mero`),
  `ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/MultiCrossingCPV.lean` (the paper-faithful
  `HungerbuhlerWasem.residueTheorem_crossing_paper_faithful_clean` and the multi-crossing PV
  engine), `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/{Residue/MultipointPV*,OnCurvePV/*,PVInfrastructure/*}`,
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Residue.lean` (`HasCauchyPVOn'`,
  `pv_integral_simple_pole`).

The fundamental-domain-specific winding machinery (`ForMathlib/*FDBoundary*`, `*CornerFTC*`,
`*CrossingAt{Rho,I}*`, `*ExitTime*`) is **not** migrated here; it is the bridge from this engine to
the valence formula and stays in the Modular Forms roadmap.

/-! ## The objects (Layers 0, 2, 4): definitions pinned as `sorry`-targets

Mathlib has none of these. The contour integral itself is `∫ t in a..b, deriv γ t • f (γ t)`
(`intervalIntegral`, agreeing with `circleIntegral` on a circle); these `def`s name the winding
number, residue, principal value, and the HW hypotheses built on it. -/

/-- **Generalized winding number** (HW Def 2.1): `n_{z₀}(γ) = PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ dz/(z − z₀)`, the
value of the contour integral for *any* piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]` and *any*
`z₀ ∈ ℂ`. Closedness (`γ a = γ b`) is **not** part of the definition; it is the hypothesis (carried
on the theorems below) under which this value is a genuine winding number — the classical integer
index for `z₀ ∉ image γ`, and in general **non-integer** for `z₀` on the curve (the geometric angle
`α/2π`). -/
noncomputable def windingNumber (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (z₀ : ℂ) : ℂ := sorry

/-- **Residue** at an isolated singularity: the order-`(−1)` Laurent coefficient of `f` at `z₀`
(for a simple pole, `lim_{z→z₀}(z − z₀)·f z`), against the `meromorphicOrderAt` / principal-part
API rather than a parallel order-of-vanishing notion. -/
noncomputable def residue (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z₀ : ℂ) : ℂ := sorry

/-- **Cauchy principal value** of a contour integral, existence-and-value form (HW): `HasCauchyPV γ
a b f v` says the symmetric-excision limit of `∮_γ f` exists and equals `v`. This is needed exactly
when a singularity of `f` lies *on* `γ`, where the ordinary integral diverges; it is kept **separate
from genuine integrability** and never silently identified with it. Layer 4 cannot be stated without
it. -/
def HasCauchyPV (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (v : ℂ) : Prop := sorry

/-- **Piecewise `C¹` on the interval between `a` and `b`.** The raw-function curve-regularity
hypothesis: `γ` is continuous on `[[a, b]]` (Mathlib's `Set.uIcc a b`, the interval robust to `a > b`) and, off
a finite breakpoint set, is `C¹` on each closed
piece. This is the regularity that AINTLIB's bundled `PiecewiseC1Path` carries *inside its type*;
stated on a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` it must be an **explicit hypothesis**, because the winding number, the
contour integral `∫ deriv γ • f (γ ·)`, and Dixon's argument are all ill-posed for an arbitrary
continuous `γ`: a space-filling continuous `γ` has no honest derivative, so `∫ deriv γ • …` is not
the contour integral at all, and Dixon's argument needs differentiability off a countable set to
make the winding number integer-valued. (The off-curve base point Dixon picks, by contrast, exists
already from continuity and compactness — the image of `[[a, b]]` is compact, so it cannot fill a
nonempty open `Ω` — and is not what this regularity is for.) This mirrors
`TauCeti.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On`; it is the base regularity the homology Cauchy theorem (Layer 3)
carries. The **on-cycle** residue theorems (Layer 4) need the stronger `IsPwC1ImmersionOn` below. -/
def IsPiecewiseC1On (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ContinuousOn γ (Set.uIcc a b) ∧
    ∃ p : Finset ℝ, ↑p ⊆ Set.Ioo (min a b) (max a b) ∧
      ∀ c d : ℝ, Set.Icc c d ⊆ Set.uIcc a b → Disjoint (↑p : Set ℝ) (Set.Ioo c d) →
        ContDiffOn ℝ 1 γ (Set.Icc c d)

/-- **Piecewise-`C¹` immersion on `[[a, b]]`** — `IsPiecewiseC1On` strengthened, over a **common**
breakpoint witness, by a non-vanishing tangent on every piece: on each breakpoint-free closed piece
`[c, d]`, the curve is `C¹` and its within-piece derivative is non-zero on **all** of `[c, d]` —
one-sided at the piece endpoints, HW's `Λ̇|_{[aₖ,aₖ₊₁]} ≠ 0` (arXiv:1808.00997, p. 3). This is the
raw-`γ` mirror of the `derivWithin_ne_zero_pieces` field of AINTLIB's `ClosedPwC1Immersion` (whose
closed partition includes the interval endpoints; closedness itself stays the theorems' separate
`γ a = γ b` hypothesis), the type its HW summit is stated over; `SatisfiesConditionA'` is likewise
typed over an immersion, since the on-cycle model-sector analysis needs a well-defined non-zero
tangent at each on-cycle singularity. The one-sided conditions are load-bearing: merely asking
`deriv γ ≠ 0` off a finite set would admit zero-speed turnarounds (`γ t = t ^ 2` on `[-1, 1]`,
whose one-sided tangents both vanish at `0`) and zero-speed seams, which are not immersions.
`derivWithin` is used because at a corner the global `deriv` is `0` by Mathlib convention, which
would falsely contradict non-vanishing; at interior points of a piece it agrees with `deriv`.
Implies `IsPiecewiseC1On` with the same witness (pieces with `c ≥ d` are degenerate). (The homology
Cauchy theorem, whose singularities lie *off* `γ`, needs only `IsPiecewiseC1On`.) -/

  ContinuousOn γ (Set.uIcc a b) ∧

        ContDiffOn ℝ 1 γ (Set.Icc c d) ∧
          ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc c d, derivWithin γ (Set.Icc c d) t ≠ 0

/-- A cycle `γ` on `[a, b]` is **null-homologous** in `Ω` when its winding number about every point
outside `Ω` vanishes (`n_w(γ) = 0` for all `w ∉ Ω`) — the hypothesis of the homology Cauchy theorem
(Layer 3) and of HW Thm 3.3 (Layer 4). -/
def IsNullHomologous (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (Ω : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ w ∉ Ω, windingNumber γ a b w = 0

/-- HW condition **(A′)**: the cycle `γ` approaches each on-cycle singularity in `S` transversally,
meeting it as a finite union of model sectors, **flat of order equal to the order of `f`'s pole
there** (HW §3). One of the two regularity conditions that make the principal value exist; stated
explicitly so the summit is honest. The prescribed pole orders come from `f` (read off by
`meromorphicOrderAt`), so `f` is part of the data: the point set `S` alone cannot supply them. -/
def ConditionAprime (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (S : Finset ℂ) : Prop := sorry

/-- HW condition **(B)**: the higher-order Laurent principal parts cancel under the
sector-cancellation identity at each on-cycle singularity, so the principal value exists for poles of
order `> 1` (HW §3). Couples `f` with the parametrization of `γ` (entry/exit tangents). -/

/-! ## Layer 1: the geometry of the winding number (HW §2)

The model-sector values, computed directly from the integral, are the per-indentation contributions
the valence formula sums. (Stated on the raw integral, which `windingNumber` packages as a PV.) -/

/-- **The model-sector winding number** (HW (2.4)). A counterclockwise circular arc of opening angle
`α` about its centre `z₀` contributes generalized winding number `α/2π`:
`(2πi)⁻¹ ∫_0^α (γ'/γ) dθ = α/2π` for `γ θ = z₀ + r·e^{iθ}`. The geometric meaning of the winding
number at a corner — specialising to `½` at `i` and `1/6` at `ρ`. -/

      = (α : ℂ) / (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ)) :=
  sorry

/-- **The winding number `½` at `i`** — the coefficient of `ord_i(f)` in the valence formula. `i` is
a *smooth* boundary point of the fundamental domain, so the valence contour indents around it by a
**semicircle** (`α = π`), with generalized winding number `π/2π = ½`. -/
theorem windingNumber_at_i {z₀ : ℂ} {r : ℝ} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ) * Complex.I)⁻¹ *
        ∫ θ in (0:ℝ)..Real.pi, deriv (circleMap z₀ r) θ / (circleMap z₀ r θ - z₀)
      = 1 / 2 :=
  sorry

/-- **The winding number `1/6` at `ρ`.** `ρ` is a **`π/3` corner** of the fundamental domain, so the
contour indents around it by a `π/3` arc, with generalized winding number `(π/3)/2π = 1/6`. The two
`ρ`-corners (`ρ` and `ρ+1`) each contribute `1/6`, summing to the `1/3` coefficient of `ord_ρ(f)`. -/

      = 1 / 6 :=
  sorry

/-- **`n_c(circle) = 1`** — the closed-curve normalization gate (reconciles with
`circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`). A full counterclockwise circle about its centre `c`
(`α = 2π`) has generalized winding number `1`; `n` is `0` outside. -/

      = 1 :=
  sorry

/-! ## Layer 2: the argument principle and the classical residue theorem -/

/-- **Local argument principle** — the per-orbit input to the valence formula. If `f` is meromorphic
on the closed disc `C(c, R)` and `c` is its only zero or pole there, of order `n = ord_c f`
(`meromorphicOrderAt`), then `∮_{C(c,R)} f'/f = 2πi · n`: the contour integral of the logarithmic
derivative recovers the order (the residue of `f'/f` at `c` is `ord_c f`). (Boundary regularity is
not hypothesised — it follows from `honly` with `R > 0`, since the centre is the only special point.)
Mathlib has `logDeriv` and `meromorphicOrderAt` but not this. -/
theorem argumentPrinciple_local {f : ℂ → ℂ} {c : ℂ} {R : ℝ} {n : ℤ} (hR : 0 < R)
    (hf : MeromorphicOn f (Metric.closedBall c R))

    circleIntegral (logDeriv f) c R = 2 * (Real.pi : ℂ) * Complex.I * (n : ℂ) :=
  sorry

/-- **The argument principle** — the valence formula's contour identity. For `f` meromorphic on the
closed disc with all zeros and poles contained in a finite set `S` inside the open ball, with integer
orders `ord`, `∮_{C(c,R)} f'/f = 2πi · Σ_{z ∈ S} ord_z(f)`: the contour integral of `f'/f` counts
zeros minus poles with multiplicity. The explicit identity the valence formula evaluates two ways
(here over the interior orbits); the on-contour points `i`, `ρ` are handled by HW Thm 3.3 (Layer 4).
(Boundary regularity follows from `hsupp` and `hS`, so it is not hypothesised.) -/

  sorry

/-- **Classical residue theorem (circle case)** — Layer 2, the case provable from Mathlib's disc
Cauchy theory: a circle bounding a disc with the poles strictly inside (integer winding number `1`
each). For `f` meromorphic on the closed disc with all singularities in a finite `S ⊆ ball c R`,
`∮_{C(c,R)} f = 2πi · Σ_{s ∈ S} Res_s f`, recovering the Cauchy integral formula. The general
arbitrary-cycle / null-homologous version is deferred to Layer 3+ (its `S = ∅` case is the homology
Cauchy theorem). -/

  sorry

/-! ## Layer 3: the global (homological) Cauchy theorem -/

/-- **The homology (global) Cauchy theorem** (Layer 3, proved by *Dixon's argument*). For `f`
holomorphic on open `Ω` and a closed cycle `γ` in `Ω` that is **null-homologous**, `∮_γ f = 0`. This
is the `S = ∅` case of the general arbitrary-cycle residue theorem, which is why that general version
sits here rather than in Layer 2. Named for the theorem (homology Cauchy), attributed to Dixon for
the proof. -/

  sorry

/-! ## Layer 4: the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3) -/

/-- **Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem** (HW Thm 3.3) — the summit. Let `U ⊆ ℂ` be
open, `S ⊆ U` finite, `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each `s ∈ S`, and `γ` a
**null-homologous** closed piecewise-`C¹` **immersion** in `U` whose singularities may lie *on* `γ`, under
conditions (A′) and (B). Then the principal value exists and
`PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ f = Σ_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`, with the generalized (non-integer) winding numbers
as weights. The basepoint stays off the poles (`hγa`) so every crossing is interior to the
parameter interval — for the intended nondegenerate closed immersions with finite `S` this is
mathematically removable by cyclic reparametrization, but it remains a formalization residual
until a reparametrization-invariance API exists (it is likewise a hypothesis of the AINTLIB
summit). Subsumes the classical residue theorem (poles off `γ`, integer weights) and the
half-residue case below.

Scope, relative to the printed theorem: HW state Thm 3.3 for a *cycle* and a singular set
without accumulation points in `U`, and allow an essential singularity on the cycle where the
cycle is locally straight (condition (A)'s second branch). This target takes a single closed
curve, a **finite** `S`, and `MeromorphicAt` at each `s ∈ S` — the scope the
`residue`/`meromorphicOrderAt` API expresses and the valence formula consumes. Each narrowing
is deliberate, not an oversight; cycles are a finite-sum layer over this statement. -/

/-- **Half-residue: the winding-`½` on-cycle case of HW Thm 3.3** — the acceptance gate and the
bridge to the valence formula's `i`, `ρ`. Stated as the genuine `S = {s}` specialisation of
`hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`: a **closed, null-homologous** piecewise-`C¹` **immersion** `γ` in an
open `U`, with `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ {s}` and meromorphic at `s`, under conditions (A′)/(B); when
the generalized winding number about `s` is `½`, the principal value equals `πi · Res_s f` — the
`S = {s}`, `n_s(γ) = ½` case of the HW sum `2πi · Σ n_s(γ)·Res_s f`. The closedness,
holomorphy-off-`s`, null-homology and (A′)/(B) hypotheses are **load-bearing**, not decoration:
without them the whole PV integral is *not* determined by `n_s(γ)` and `Res_s f` alone (a non-closed
arc integrates the holomorphic part of `f` to a nonzero remainder — e.g. `γ(t) = e^{i t}` on
`[0, π]`, `s = 0`, `f z = z⁻¹ + 1` has winding `½` and residue `1` but integral `πi − 2`). -/
