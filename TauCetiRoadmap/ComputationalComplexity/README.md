# Roadmap: Computational Complexity Theory

This file lays out a roadmap for the formalization of basic computational complexity theory
based on Turing Machines that operate over binary strings. 
It focuses on complexity classes derived from polynomial time functions computed by Turing machines. By this, I mean not just the class `P` but also classes derived from `P` that can be stated without reference to space or computations that take superpolynomial time, or to other computational models. 

For example, `NP` would be covered, because it can be stated in terms of a polynomial-time witness verifying operation, 
but `EXP` would not be covered because it doesn't use polynomial time, `PSPACE` would not be covered because it references space, and `P/Poly` would not be covered because it references circuits.

This should be suitable task for AI, because while the descriptions of low-level Turing machines can be painful for a human to write, often the reasoning behind why such machines work is fairly simple, and so it should be possible for an AI to grind through the definition of many such machines, perhaps reaching the point where a human who wants to build on top of the development can begin to ignore the very lowest level of details and just use the API that the AI provides.

## Framework and preexisting material: Binary strings

Existing formalizations of computability theory or complexity theory in `/Mathlib/Computability/TuringMachine` or `/Cslib/Computability/Machines/Turing/SingleTape` tend to provide machines that operate over an arbitrary finite alphabet. This proposal, however, suggests using a specialized machine definition that operates over binary strings (i.e. `List Bool`) as its input and output type. The reasoning for this is that it is generally considered that alphabet choice does not affect most questions in complexity theory, and so it will perhaps be simpler to avoid the need to repeatedly include `variable` statements to specify the alphabet. Thus, we can just use

In order to do this, it will be necessary to encode types as Binary strings. 
This development should do so using a typeclass similar to Mathlib's `Computability.Encoding`

```lean
/-- A canonical encoding of a type as bitstrings (`List Bool`). -/
class BitstringEncoding (α : Type*) where
  /-- The encoding function. -/
  encode : α → List Bool
  /-- The decoding function; `none` on bitstrings that encode nothing. -/
  decode : List Bool → Option α
  /-- Decoding is a left inverse of encoding. -/
  decode_encode : ∀ x, decode (encode x) = some x
```

The concept here is that, even though different references might construct encodings for a type in different ways, these ways should all by polynomial-time transcodable to each other, so it does not matter too much how we encode a type, as long as it is consistent and somewhat sensible.

We can then derive this class in a variety of ways:

1. Subtypes can be encoded as their base types.
2. Composite types (Like `Prod`, `List`) can be encoded using a self-delimiting transformation that takes a `List Bool` and converts it to a format where it can be parsed as part of a larger block with information about where the delimitation starts and ends. This delimitation operation can then be applied to each suubcomponent.
3. Disjunctive type constructors (Like `Sum`, `Option`, `Bool`) can be encoded by having a prefix representing which case we are in, followed by the encoding of any additional information for that value (or a list of delimited pieces of information).
4. `Nat`s can be encoded in binary. Other numeric types like `Int`, `Rat`, can then be derived using principles above (Ints as disjunctively either negative, zero, or positive, and `Rat`s as a subtype of pair of an `Int` and `Nat`)

Here is a suggested implementation of a delimiting operation

```lean
def delimit : List Bool → List Bool
  | [] => [false]
  | b :: l => true :: b :: delimit l
```

## Construction of low-level Polynomial time Turing Machines

Once this class is defined, we can write a definition for computability of a function which should look something like

```lean
def IsPolyTime {α β : Type} [BitstringEncoding α] [BitstringEncoding β] (f : α → β) : Prop :=
  Nonempty (@TM2ComputableInPolyTime Bool Bool (BitstringEncoding.encode α) (BitstringEncoding.encode β) f)
```

Once this is in place, we can prove several facts about polynomial time computability of various encoding operations:

- For the types and type constructors above, their constructors and eliminators are often polynomial time (List folding is a bit more complicated)
- Reassociation of pairs is polynomial time 
- Many of the basic functions defined on types in `Data` are polynomial time.

The AI could either try to generate a list of these functions en masse, or identify them as they beome needed downstream and add them one at a time.

## Complexity Theory Basics

With this framework in place, we can start to define the basics of complexity theory. We can define the type of decision problems and the type of complexity classes as

```lean
abbrev BitstringDecisionProblem : Type := Bitstring → Bool

abbrev ComplexityClass : Type := Set BitstringDecisionProblem
```

And we can proceed to define a number of complexity classes:

- `P` as the set of decision problems decidable in polynomial time by a deterministic
  Turing machine.
- `∃ᴾ C`, the set of decision problems that can be decided using polynomially long
  membership witnesses over `C`.
- `∀ᴾ C`, the set of decision problems that can be decided using polynomially long
  non-membership witnesses over `C`.
- `NP` as `∃ᴾ P`, the set of decision problems decidable in polynomial time by a
  nondeterministic Turing machine.
- `coNP` as `∀ᴾ P`, the set of decision problems whose complements are in `NP`.
- `Σᴾ n` and `Πᴾ n` as the `n`th levels of the polynomial time hierarchy, defined inductively as
  `Σᴾ 0 = P`, `Σᴾ (n + 1) = ∃ᴾ (Πᴾ n)`, and `Πᴾ n = (Σᴾ n).complement`.
- `PH` as the union of all levels of the polynomial time hierarchy.
- `BPP` as the set of decision problems decidable with two-sided error at most `1/3` by
  counting witnesses for a polynomial time machine.
- `RP` as the set of decision problems decidable with one-sided error at most `1/3`:
  members are accepted on at least `2/3` of witnesses, non-members on none.
- `coRP` as the set of decision problems whose complements are in `RP`.
- `ZPP` as the intersection of `RP` and `coRP`.

And perhaps also

- `AM`
- `MA`
- `PP`

## Basic inclusions

We can then prove basic inclusions among these

* P is contained in NP, coNP, and BPP, by virtue of being able to make a trivial witness and ignore it.
* RP and coRP contain BPP by using the same witness checking procedure

## NP-Completeness, Cook-Levin, and the Karp Problems

With these definitions in place, we can define polynomial time many-one reductions between decision problems 
as polynomial time functions that preserve membership in the problem.
We can then define [NP Hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) as the class of problems that any problem in NP is reducible to,
and [NP-Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) as the intersection of this class with NP.
We can then prove the [Cook-Levin theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem), 
and from there prove the NP-completeness of [the 21 Karp problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems) by constructing the reductions.
